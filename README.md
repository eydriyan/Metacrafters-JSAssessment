# NFT Collection Project

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) minting system using JavaScript. It allows for minting NFTs with specific metadata, listing all minted NFTs, and getting the total number of minted NFTs.

Features
- Minting NFTs: Create NFTs with custom metadata including name, eye color, shirt type, and bling.
- Listing NFTs: Display the metadata of all minted NFTs.
- Total Supply: Retrieve the total number of NFTs minted.
